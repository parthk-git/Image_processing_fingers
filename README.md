# Image_processing_fingers
IM-MAT-THON code submission

READ ME

Run the file fingers.m directly on matlab
Copy the code fingers.m and paste on the matlab terminal
Press enter

PreConditions:
At the start, all the five fingers should be straight
The hand should preferably be at the center of the screen beacuse if it is at the corner, some fingers might not be in the range of the camera
Hold in position till "Ready" appears on terminal
Start bending the fingers at random when the terminal prints "Ready"!
Hold in position for some time
Assuming Hand will be almost straight, that is, it should be at extreme angles like 90 degrees, 135 degrees etc (till 30 degrees fine...will give result)
Assuming that the hand will not move much from its initial position..Slight movement is fine


The required array will be printed on the terminal
Any window frame is fine but best results with 480x640
Appropriate comments are made to make the code readable/understandable
Attempt has been made to make the algorithm using simple FOR loops , IF statements etc without using much of pre-defined functions
